Extracting real-time insights from multi-modal data streams across diverse domains presents an ongoing challenge. A promising solution lies in the implementation of Streaming Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques. YDB enhances this approach by offering robust services for both streaming and vector search, facilitating more efficient and effective data processing and retrieval.
YDB is a versatile open-source Distributed SQL Database that combines high availability and scalability with strong consistency and ACID transactions.
